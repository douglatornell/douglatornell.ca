============================================
 VanPyZ Talk PyYAML, flickrapi, and TkInter
============================================

This is the development directory for a talk I gave at the VanPyZ
meeting on 1-Dec-2009.

* The talk slides are in ``LivingPicsVanPyZ.odp`` which was exported as
  ``LivingPicsVanPyZ.pdf`` for uploading to the web.

* ``lyt-movwaves.odp`` is the presentation theme.

* The code snippets included in the presentation were produced by
  running ``rst2odp`` on ``code-slides.rst`` to get Pygments
  highlighted code. The results were copy-pasted into the talk slide
  deck. Use the ``rst2odp`` virtualenv.
