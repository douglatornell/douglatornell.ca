## site_url -- Your site's full URL
# Your "site" is the same thing as your _site directory.
#  If you're hosting a blogofile powered site as a subdirectory of a larger
#  non-blogofile site, then you would set the site_url to the full URL
#  including that subdirectory: "http://www.yoursite.com/path/to/blogofile-dir"
site.url = "http://douglatornell.ca"

## site.author -- Your name, the author of the website.
# This is optional. If set to anything other than None, the
# simple_blog template creates a meta tag for the site author.
site.author = "Doug Latornell"
