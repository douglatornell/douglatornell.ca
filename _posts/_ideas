Ideas for Future Posts
======================

* Database table reflection into SQLAlchemy objects in Pyramid based
  on discussion with Jonathan Vanasco on pylons-discuss list and in
  https://gist.github.com/1556734

* Stacking Pyramid view_config decorators, and passing parameters in
  routes based on discussion with Michael Merickel on pylons-discuss
  list.

* Migration of posts from b2evolution to blogofile.

* Add a markup format option to `blogofile blog post create` so that
  it can create something other than .markdown files.
