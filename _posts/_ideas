Ideas for Future Posts
======================

* Silent failure of Django test fixtures when PyYAML isn't
  installed. Avoid the pain by using a pip requirements file, and
  explicitly specifying the serialization method for the fixtures with
  a file extension.

* Database table reflection into SQLAlchemy objects in Pyramid based
  on discussion with Jonathan Vanasco on pylons-discuss list and in
  https://gist.github.com/1556734

* Stacking Pyramid view_config decorators, and passing parameters in
  routes based on discussion with Michael Merickel on pylons-discuss
  list.

* A blogofile rst filter that handles `code` directives.

* Migration of posts from b2evolution to blogofile.
