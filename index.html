  <h3>Doug Latornell</h3>

  <p>
    I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  I'm a mechanical
    engineer, educated at Queen's University, and the University of
    British Columbia.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a marathon cyclist with
    the <a href="http://randonneurs.bc.ca">BC Randonneurs Cycling
    Club</a> and in 2003 I became an <em>ancien</em>
    of <a
    href="http://www.paris-brest-paris.org/EN/">Paris-Brest-Paris</a>.
    I was event director for the
    2004 <a href="http://randonneurs.bc.ca/rocky/rm1200.html">Rocky
    Mtn 1200</a> and am planning to ride that event this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work for <a href="http://www.mds.nordion.com/">MDS Nordion</a>
    where I manage projects, do mechanical design, model isotope
    production processes
    using <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, and create
    database-driven web applications for monitoring and analyzing
    production process data.  I started out
    using <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> for those projects,
    but more recently have been
    using <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
    and <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2006 I spent 6 months on sabbatical with my
    physicist/mathematician/oceanographer
    wife, <a href="http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~sallen/">Dr. Susan
    Allen</a>, living in St-Renan, near Brest in France.  We worked on
    Susan's <a href="http://www.stratogem.ubc.ca/">biophysical model
    of the Strait of Georgia</a>, cycled lots,
    and <strong>really</strong> enjoyed living in Brittany.  We
    blogged about the experience
    at <a
    href="http://sadahome.ca/blogs/paradocs.php">sadahome.ca/blogs/paradocs.php</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, I blog (but not very often)
    at <a
    href="http://sadahome.ca/blogs/adventures.php">sadahome.ca/blogs/adventures.php</a>
    and post images (also too infrequently)
    at <a
    href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sada_images/">flickr.com/photos/sada_images/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At home, I manage our network
    of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and Mac
    computers, try to stay on top of maintenance and wheelbuilding for
    our fleet of bicycles, and cook <em>way</em> too infrequently.  I
    also hack on a variety of personal projects in Python 'cause
    it's <a href="http://xkcd.com/353/">so much fun</a> and so
    elegant.
