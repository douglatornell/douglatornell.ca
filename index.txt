I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  I'm a mechanical
engineer, educated at Queen's University, and the University of
British Columbia.

I'm a marathon cyclist with the `BC Randonneurs Cycling Club`_ and in
2003 I became an *ancien* of `Paris-Brest-Paris`_.  I was event
director for the 2004 `Rocky Mtn 1200`_ and I `rode the Rocky`_ in 2008.

I work for `MDS Nordion`_ where I manage projects, do mechanical
design, model isotope production processes using `SciPy`_, and create
database-driven web applications for monitoring and analyzing
production process data.  I started out using `PHP`_ for those
projects, but more recently have been using `Python`_ and
`TurboGears`_.

In 2006 I spent 6 months on sabbatical with my
physicist/mathematician/oceanographer wife, `Dr. Susan Allen`_, living
in St-Renan, near Brest in France.  We worked on Susan's `biophysical
model of the Strait of Georgia`_, cycled lots, and **really** enjoyed
living in Brittany.  We blogged about the experience at
`sadahome.ca/blogs/paradocs.php`_.

These days, I blog (but not very often)
at `sadahome.ca/blogs/adventures.php`_
and post images (also too infrequently)
at `flickr.com/photos/sada_images/`_.

At home, I manage our network of `OpenBSD`_ and Mac computers, try to
stay on top of maintenance and wheelbuilding for our fleet of
bicycles, and cook *way* too infrequently.  I also hack on a variety
of personal projects in Python 'cause it's `so much fun`_ and so
elegant.
